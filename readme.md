## Config

Create a config.json file and put your discord bot token in it.

```
{
    "token": "your_token",
    "channelId: "your channel id"
}
```

## Messages

Iago will respond with random messages when it feels like it. To have any
effect you need to customise the messages to be relevant to your community.

Create a messages.json file and put your commands in it.

```
{
    "messages": [ "Array of strings that can be chosen randomly" ],
    "prompts": {
        "corri": [
            "Array of strings that can respond to any message that prompts a reply, welcome or unwelcome",
            "Tastes like soap"
        ]
    },
    "reacts": {
        "hi": [ "ðŸ‘‹", "ðŸŒŠ" ]
    },
    "cron": [
        {
            "condition": "0 0 * * *",
            "messages": [
                "The time is midnight"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
